### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5 Part 1 is when I really began to understand arguments, how they work, but mostly on how they are important. I liked this lab because while it was difficult trying to figure out arguments worked at first being able to see the results and how they passed the unit test felt good. I also found it interesting how we could input arguments on the terminal and due to the conditions we coded we were able to create a sandwich.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7 Part 1 was one of my favorite labs since it was the first lab that seemed as if we were coding a small game. During this lab it was one of the first times for me to code something other than printing out a couple words so it was interesting to see what we can get done through programs like these. Another thing is that this lab worked as a building block that we continued adding on to as the semester progressed and making it more complex so itâ€™s nice being able to see it become more secret as we learn more.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12 part 1 was very interesting since it was the first time I coded something that went beyond numbers and letters that got printed in the terminal. It was also very interesting how we were able to create a gif by compiling many images and being able to do that through code was even more fun to do. Although it was difficult, being able to see the end results was worth it.
